        "description": "xan is a command line tool that can be used to process CSV files directly\nfrom the shell. It has been written in Rust to be as fast as possible, use\nas little memory as possible, and can easily handle very large CSV files\n(Gigabytes). It is also able to leverage parallelism (through multithreading)\nto make some tasks complete as fast as your computer can allow. It can easily\npreview, filter, slice, aggregate, sort, join CSV files, and exposes a large\ncollection of composable commands that can be chained together to perform a\nwide variety of typical tasks. xan also leverages its own expression language\nso you can perform complex tasks that cannot be done by relying on the\nsimplest commands. This minimalistic language has been tailored for CSV data\nand is faster than evaluating typical dynamically-typed languages such as\nPython, Lua, JavaScript etc.",
