  summary: Opus Interactive Audio Codec
  description: |
    Opus is a totally open, royalty-free, highly versatile
    audio codec. Opus is unmatched for interactive speech
    and music transmission over the Internet, but is also
    intended for storage and streaming applications. It is
    standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force
    (IETF) as RFC 6716 which incorporated technology from
    Skype's SILK codec and Xiph.Org's CELT codec.
