        "description": "The goal of this project is to offer a few tools that make it easy for you to refresh charts in marimo. This can be useful during a PyTorch training loop where you might want to update a chart on every iteration, but there are many other use-cases for this too.\n\nThe library provides three widgets:\n\n  ImageRefreshWidget - Displays images that can be updated dynamically. Perfect for refreshing matplotlib plots or any image content.\n  HTMLRefreshWidget - Renders HTML content that can be updated on the fly. Great for Altair charts, plotly visualizations, or custom HTML.\n  ProgressBar - A modern progress bar with dark mode support. Ideal for tracking training loops or long-running operations.\n\nThe trick to get updating charts to work is to leverage anywidget. These widgets have a loop that is independant of the marimo cells which means that you can update a chart even if the cell hasn't completed running. The goal of this library is to make it easy to use this pattern by giving you a few utilities.",
