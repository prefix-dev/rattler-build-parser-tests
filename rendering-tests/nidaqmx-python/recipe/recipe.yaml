  summary: Python API for interacting with NI-DAQmx
  description: |
    The nidaqmx package contains an API (Application Programming Interface) for
    interacting with the NI-DAQmx driver. The package is implemented in Python.
    This package was created and is supported by NI. The package is implemented
    as a complex, highly object-oriented wrapper around the NI-DAQmx C API using
    the ctypes Python library.
