  summary: Python tools and utilities for working with the AnyBody Modeling System
  description: |
    AnyPyTools is a toolkit for working with the AnyBody Modeling System (AMS)
    from Python. Its main purpose is to launch AnyBody simulations and collect
    results. It has a scheduler to launch multiple instances of AMS utilising
    computers with multiple cores. AnyPyTools makes it possible to run
    parameter and Monte Carlo studies more efficiently than from within the
    AnyBody Modeling System.
