  summary: A very fast and expressive template engine.
  description: |
    Jinja is a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine. Special
    placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python
    syntax. Then the template is passed data to render the final document.

    It includes:

    -   Template inheritance and inclusion.
    -   Define and import macros within templates.
    -   HTML templates can use autoescaping to prevent XSS from untrusted
        user input.
    -   A sandboxed environment can safely render untrusted templates.
    -   AsyncIO support for generating templates and calling async
        functions.
    -   I18N support with Babel.
    -   Templates are compiled to optimized Python code just-in-time and
        cached, or can be compiled ahead-of-time.
    -   Exceptions point to the correct line in templates to make debugging
        easier.
    -   Extensible filters, tests, functions, and even syntax.

    Jinja's philosophy is that while application logic belongs in Python if
    possible, it shouldn't make the template designer's job difficult by
    restricting functionality too much.
