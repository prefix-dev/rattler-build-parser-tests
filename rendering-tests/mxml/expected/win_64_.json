        "description": "This is a feature complete XML library containing a validating parser as well as a modern C++ API for the data structures. It also supports serializing custom data structures.\nThe core of this library is a validating XML parser with DTD processing and all. On top of this are implemented an API for manipulating XML data in a DOM like fashion and a serialization API. As a bonus there\u2019s also an XPath implementation, albeit this is limited to XPath 1.0.\nThis XML library was extracted from [libzeep](https://github.com/mhekkel/libzeep) since having a separate and simple XML library is more convenient. The API is unfortunately no longer compatible since the goal was to be more standards compliant. E.g., mxml::element should now be a complete [Sequence Container](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/SequenceContainer).",
