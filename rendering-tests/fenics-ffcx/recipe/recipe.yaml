about:
  summary: The FEniCSx Form Compiler
  description: |
    FFCx is a new version of the FEniCS Form Compiler.
    It is being actively developed and is compatible with DOLFINx.

    FFCx is a compiler for finite element variational forms.
    From a high-level description of the form in the Unified Form Language (UFL),
    it generates efficient low-level C code that can be used to assemble the corresponding discrete operator (tensor).
    In particular, a bilinear form may be assembled into a matrix and a linear form may be assembled into a vector.
    FFCx may be used either from the command line (by invoking the ffcx command) or as a Python module (import ffcx).
