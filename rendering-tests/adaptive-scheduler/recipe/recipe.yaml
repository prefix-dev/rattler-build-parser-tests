  summary: An asynchronous scheduler for Adaptive
  description: |
    The Adaptive scheduler solves the following problem, you need to run a few 100
    learners and can use >1k cores. `ipyparallel` and `dask.distributed` provide
    very powerful engines for interactive sessions. However, when you want to
    connect to >1k cores it starts to struggle. Besides that, on a shared cluster
    there is often the problem of starting an interactive session with ample space
    available. Our approach is to schedule a different job for each `
    adaptive.Learner`. The creation and running of these jobs are managed by `
    adaptive-scheduler`. This means that your calculation will definitely run, even
    though the cluster might be fully occupied at the moment. Because of this
    approach, there is almost no limit to how many cores you want to use. You can
    either use 10 nodes for 1 job (`learner`) or 1 core for 1 job (`learner`) while
    scheduling hundreds of jobs. Everything is written such that the computation is
    maximally local. This means that is one of the jobs crashes, there is no
    problem and it will automatically schedule a new one and continue the
    calculation where it left off (because of Adaptive's periodic saving
    functionality). Even if the central "job manager" dies, the jobs will continue
    to run (although no new jobs will be scheduled.)
