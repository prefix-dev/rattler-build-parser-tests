  summary: Time Series and Econometric Modeling
  description: |-
    Time series analysis, (dis)aggregation and manipulation,
    e.g. time series extension, merge, projection, lag, lead,
    delta, moving and cumulative average and product, selection by
    index, date and year-period, conversion to daily, monthly,
    quarterly, (semi)annually. Simultaneous equation models
    definition, estimation, simulation and forecasting with
    coefficient restrictions, error autocorrelation, exogenization,
    add-factors, impact and interim multipliers analysis,
    conditional equation evaluation, rational expectations,
    endogenous targeting and model renormalization, structural
